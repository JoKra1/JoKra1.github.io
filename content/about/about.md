I am currently in the first year of my PhD at the [University of Groningen's](https://www.rug.nl)  Bernoulli Institute for Mathematics, Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence.

My research interests are:

- **Computational Neuroscience**
    - How can cognitive operations be inferred from brain-related signals in a data-driven fashion?
    - Which cognitive operations enable language comprehension & production?
- **Statistics**
    - In particular GLMMs, GAMMs & Hidden semi-Markov models!
