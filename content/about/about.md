## Hey all and welcome to my webpage!

$~$

I am currently in the first year of my PhD at the [University of Groningen's](https://www.rug.nl)  Bernoulli Institute for Mathematics, Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence. My supervisors are 
[Dr. Jacolien van Rij](http://jacolienvanrij.com) and [Prof. Dr. Jelmer P. Borst](https://www.jelmerborst.nl).

My research interests are:

- **Computational & Mathematical Neuroscience**
    - How can cognitive operations be inferred from brain-related signals in a data-driven fashion?
    - Which cognitive operations enable language comprehension & production?
- **Statistics**
    - In particular smoothness selection for (sparse) GAMMs & GAMMLSS models and combining these with Hidden semi-Markov models (check out my Python toolbox [mssm](https://github.com/JoKra1/mssm/tree/main))!
