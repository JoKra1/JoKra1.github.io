I am currently in the first year of my PhD at the [University of Groningen](https://www.rug.nl).

My research interests are:

- **Computational Neuroscience**
    - Decoding cognitive operations from brain-related signals!
    - Which cognitive operations enable language comprehension & production?
- **Statistics**
    - In particular GLMMs, GAMMs & Hidden semi-Markov models!
